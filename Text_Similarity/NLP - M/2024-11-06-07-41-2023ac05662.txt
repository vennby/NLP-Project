Name - Aarau Gotra BitsID-2023ac05662@wilp.bits-pilani.ac.in 1. Using only the idea that in the equation (=AB where C, A, s are nxn matrices, the ithrow of the- matrix C for Isisn is obtained by taking a linear Combination of the rows of B where the combining Coefficients come from the ith row of A, show that the inverse of a lower triangular matrix is a lower triangular matrix.

Solution Givent (=AB where A, C, B are nxn matrices Toprovet inverse of a lower triangular matrix is a laver triangular matrix.

Proof - To show that the inverse of a lower triangular matrix is also a lower triangular

matrix, use the property of metrix multiplication described in the problem: the i-the row of the matrix c (where (=AB) is obtained by

taking a linear Combination of the rows of B with the Combining Coefficients coming from the ith row of A

Let Me be a lower triangular matrix of order nxn. To show that it's inverse MY is also a lower triangular matrix

Consider Mand M+ Such that .: MM+ = I.

since M is lower triangular, all entries above the diagonal one zero.

Consider the matrix product MM+ = I. the ith row of the identity matrix I (denoted as Ii)

is Ii = (0,0, \_\_ 1, ... 0,0)

with a 1 in the ith position and O elsewhere. Linear combination for Rows of MY.

The im row of MY is determined by the requirement
