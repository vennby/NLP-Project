C= AB where C,A,B are nen matrices

Let B be a lower triangular matrix of sise nxn, B= bij, where by =0 for ici.

Let us Prove B-1 is also lowers triangular.

Suppose A is a non matis such the C=AB (given) then C= nxn matrix.

Each row i of C is obtained by taking a linear combination of the rows of B , where coefficients come from ith row of A.

Now (-1=B'A'

11 B is invertible C=AB=> c-1= A-B-' 0 B' is the inverse of lower triangular matrix B . Inverse of lower triangular matux is also lower triangular.

At is the inverse of A. From the properties of matins multiplication A-1 is also lower triangular.

Since B+ and A+ are both lower triangular then c-1=B-A- will also be lower tecangular.

Il n is an eigen value of a square males A there exists a non-zero vector v such that Av: nu

The eigenvalues of A are the roots of this polynomial

det (A - nI) = 0

where I is the nyn identity moters. 1

Cet det (A) = n/, where te is an integer, Then det ( A-NI ) = (-1) " det (nI-A) = (-1) "(n2-tr (A) n"-"+ .... + (-1) " det (A) = 0 here to(A) = trace of A

Since, n is an eigen value of A

det (A-NI) = 0 implies n dirdes det1).

.: det (A)= nk for some integer ke.

yves that, A is an invertible mateix of order n This means there exists, A- and i rank (A) = n AA= A'A = I .

Consider a matex B of nxn order.

Multiply Both sides of the equation by AB by A+ on the left gues

A-1(AB) = 'A 'AB (A'A) B = 1B B= B
